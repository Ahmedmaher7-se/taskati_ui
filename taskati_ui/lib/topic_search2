TypeAdapter in flutter

we use it to store data in classes
 by converting the object into binary and back

 1. we add hive to the project
 2. create a model class
 3. generate the Adapter 
 flutter pub run build_runner build
 This will create user.g.dart which contains the UserAdapter code.

 4. register the adapter and open box
  Hive.registerAdapter(UserAdapter()); // register the adapter
  await Hive.openBox<User>('users');   // open a box named "users"
5. save and read data
  

  In short:

Create a class with @HiveType and @HiveField.

Run build_runner â†’ generates Adapter automatically.

Register the Adapter in main().

Use box.put() to save, and box.get() to read.
